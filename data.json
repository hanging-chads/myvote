Skrmetta was elected by his fellow elected commissioners to serve as chairman in January of 2013, replacing former chair Foster Campbell (D).    Skrmetta earned endorsements from several state organizations for his 2014 campaign, which can be found here. He faced two challengers in his 2014 re-election, as well as scrutiny over an alleged email he sent to the Gulf State Renewable Energies Industry Association seeking support for his campaign. Read more about ethics concerns raised by opponent Forest Wright in the campaign issues section.    Skrmetta was an at-large delegate to the 2016 Republican National Convention from Louisiana. Skrmetta was one of 18 delegates from Louisiana bound by state party rules to support Donald Trump at the convention. As of July 13, 2016, Trump had approximately 1,542 delegates. The winner of the Republican nomination needed the support of 1,237 delegates. Trump formally won the nomination on July 19, 2016.",

On June 14, 2017, Scalise was shot and wounded by a gunman while at a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Va. Over 50 rounds were reported to have been fired, wounding members of the Capitol Hill police and congressional staffers.   Scalise won re-election in 2016.    He is the current House majority whip. He beat out Marlin Stutzman (R-IN) and Peter Roskam (R-IL) for the position. The whip post became open when Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) took over for Eric Cantor as majority leader.   He previously was a member of the Louisiana State Senate in 2008 and a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1995 to 2007.   Based on analysis of multiple outside rankings, Scalise is one of the most reliable Republican votes, meaning he can be considered a safe vote for the Republican Party in Congress.",

Cassidy announced on April 3, 2013, that he would challenge incumbent Mary Landrieu (D) for the Senate seat in Louisiana. Cassidy and Landrieu were the top two vote-getters in the November 4 \"jungle primary.\" Cassidy defeated Landrieu in a runoff election on December 6, 2014. Some speculated that the Landrieu-Cassidy runoff election would receive significant outside spending and national media attention because the winner of the race was expected to decide which party would gain control of the Senate. The race, however, was less competitive and contentious because Republicans secured control of the United States Senate on November 4, 2014.",
